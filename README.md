This portfolio of work was created for the University of Leeds 
module GEOG5003 Programming for spatial analysis.

Within the work agents were created and plotted into random positions
on an axis using the matplotlib module within python. A background
environment with set values was then imported from a csv file to 
create a raster background. The agents were then set up to move, 
interact and eat the background. This model draws parallels to sheep
moving at random and consuming grass in a field. These sheep could 
then share the background with any neighbours. In earlier versions of
the model a number of iterations could be user defined and later on
this was defined by how much the sheep had consumed. Finally, wolves
were added. These also moved randomly and should they come within a 
settable distance of a sheep, they would consume the sheep.

Five key stages have been submitted to show the progression of the work.
Each has a separate agentbased framework for ease and the wolves also
have a separate module created with them.
